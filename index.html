        <!-- Brief personal bio -->
        <p>
            I am studying an Information Technology Engineering at Universidad Politécnica de Tlaxcala. My map 
            covers a lot of areas, like networking, programming, enterprise administration, and IoT, but I'm actually
            focusing on web development and logical programming because those areas are I like the most. My main learning
            via is Udemy right now, and for other skills, like mathematical logic, programming logic, English, etc.,
            I'm using some nice free and paid apps on my smartphone.
        </p>
